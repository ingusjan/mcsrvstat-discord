## Hosting

### Recommended Hosting: Hetzner Cloud with Coolify

[![Hetzner Cloud](https://cdn.hetzner.com/assets/Uploads/Hetzner-Logo-slogan_space-trans.png)](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=YBJPKaZ3842f)

The easiest way to host this bot is to deploy Coolify using Hetzner Cloud:

1. Sign up for [Hetzner Cloud](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=YBJPKaZ3842f)
2. Deploy Coolify using Hetzner's one-click app: [Coolify on Hetzner](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/apps/list/coolify/)
3. Within Coolify, create a new project that includes:
- This Node.js application (connect to your GitHub repository)
- A MongoDB database within the same project
4. Copy the MongoDB URI from Coolify into your application's environment variables
5. Deploy your application

You can also host this bot on any platform that supports Node.js applications and MongoDB.

## Database

The bot uses MongoDB to store:

- Player activity data (when each player was last seen online)
- The ID of the last status message for persistence across restarts

MongoDB provides better reliability, scalability, and performance compared to the previous JSON file storage. You can use a local MongoDB instance or a cloud-hosted solution like MongoDB Atlas for better reliability.

## Updating

To update the bot to the latest version:

```

git pull
yarn
yarn build
yarn start

```
